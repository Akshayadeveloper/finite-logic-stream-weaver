<b>FINITE LOGIC: StreamWeaver - Low-Latency Transactional Processor</b>

StreamWeaver is a conceptual framework for processing data streams with a guaranteed exactly-once delivery and sub-5ms latency target. It achieves this by implementing a transactional consumption and storage pattern using atomic commits.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

In high-stakes environments (finance, IoT), duplicated or dropped messages are unacceptable. StreamWeaver uses transaction IDs and atomic database commits to ensure that a message is only marked as processed after its successful storage, eliminating data loss and duplication risks.
